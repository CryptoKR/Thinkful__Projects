    "The main component of this capstone is a research proposal. Using the data set you selected, propose and outline an experiment plan. The plan should consist of three key components:\n",

    "* A rollout plan showing how you would implement and rollout the experiment\n",
    "* An evaluation plan showing what constitutes success in this experiment\n",
